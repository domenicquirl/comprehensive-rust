# Welcome to Session 7

Over the next two sessions, we will cover topics relating to building 
large-scale software in Rust:

- Iterators: a deep dive on the `Iterator` trait.
- Modules and visibility.
- Testing.
- Error handling: panics, `Result`, and the try operator `?`.
- Unsafe Rust: the escape hatch when you can't express yourself in safe Rust.
